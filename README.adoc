== Sample 1

This sample demonstrates a simple producer and consumer; the producer sends objects of type `Foo1` and the consumer receives objects of type `Foo2` (the objects have the same field, `foo`).

The producer uses a `JsonSerializer`; the consumer uses the `StringDeserializer` that is automatically configured by Spring Boot, together with a `StringJsonMessageConverter` which converts to the type of the listener method argument.

Run the application and use curl to send some data:

`$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/send/foo/bar`

Console:

`2018-11-05 10:03:40.216  INFO 39766 --- [ fooGroup-0-C-1] com.example.Application                  : Received: Foo2 [foo=bar]`

The consumer is configured with a `SeekToCurrentErrorHandler` which replays failed messages up to 2 times, each after a 1 second delay and, after retries are exhausted, sends a bad message to a dead-letter topic.

`$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/send/foo/fail`

A second `@KafkaListener` consumes the raw JSON from the message.
